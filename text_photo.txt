Caveats

8 x 8 blocks are too small

"Limited” to 12 bit samples

Bad quality for high compression rations
Arithmetic coding not used due to patents
HVS optimization barely used

In general, most devices/apps do not allow
users to specify all JPEG parameters

Awful results if wrongly used (text, diagrams)
